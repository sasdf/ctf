> Shamir did the job for you, just connect to the challenge and get the flag.


## Time
8 hours

Actually, it only tooks me 1.5 hour to solve it after getting into the right direction.  
I wasted a lot of time guessing the code and poking its PRNG ðŸ˜¡.


# Behavior
```
Here's a base32-encoded and encrypted flag: DUHUKDEVNOPMLPYNJGHSAFJECOSJPUNENVP5J2NCJGADRLT7CRZQ====
To decrypt it you need 5 coefficients. I'll only give you 3
coefficients 1: 1.0922~[491 more digits]~5705, 717~[33 more digits]~542.4453~[453 more digits]~0219
coefficients 2: 1.1527~[491 more digits]~1035, 808~[33 more digits]~638.0541~[453 more digits]~6787
coefficients 3: 1.9277~[491 more digits]~3298, 345~[33 more digits]~353.7075~[453 more digits]~1995
```

We don't have any source code in this challenge.
According to the description, it may uses shamir secret sharing to split the key into 5 pieces.
However, we only have 3 of them.


# Solution
## TL;DR
1. Guess what the service does
2. Multiply $$10^{450}$$ to each number and truncate the fraction to integer
3. Build the lattice
4. Run LLL to find the shortest integer solution
5. Decrypt the flag with AES-CBC

## Shamir Secret Sharing
[Shamir secret sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing)
is used to split a secret into multiple pieces.
It has two parameters, $$n$$ and $$k$$.
The secret will be split into $$n$$ pieces,
and you'll need $$k$$ pieces to reconstruct the secret.
Furthermore, you won't gain any knowledge of the secret with less than $$k$$ pieces (when implemented correctly).

Technically, it defines a polynomial of degree $$k - 1$$: 

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} s_i x^i
$$

where $$s_0$$ is the secret and all other coefficients are randomly generated.
Those split secret pieces are the points on this curve.
We'll need at least $$k$$ points to reconstruct the curve, and it can be done using lagrange polynomial.

Typically, the shamir secret sharing works in a finite field instead of the reals.
The precision in this task is pretty high, which gives us excessive information about the secret.

To solve this task,
you have to guess that the coefficients are positive integers and they're quite small (~40 digits compares to 500 digits fraction).

I'll talk about the analysis before I came up with this guess.
You can jump to the last section about LLL if you aren't interesting on the reason.


## Random numbers
Without any knowledge about the service,
I start from dumping 3000 pairs from the server and analyze how they are generated.

I dump with 16 threads in parallel,
and I found that some output are the same.
The collision probability is about 0.03,
and all collisions only happened in succesive runs.
It means the server may use a time-seeded PRNG (possible milliseconds).

Next I trying to figure out how they generate `x`,
Here's the distribution of `x` I got from the server.

![x_dist]({_files/x_dist.png})

Most of the `x` are closed to 1, and all of them are bigger than 1.
The distribution of `1/x` seems to be uniform distribution.

Moreover, the number of `1/x` looks like:

```
0.5372495835723414270290732019930146634578704833984375
0.1468025157144856596147519667283631861209869384765625
0.39606395612572253828176371825975365936756134033203125
```

They are actually generated by `rangrange(2^53) / 2^53`.

Now we know how `x` are generated, how about the coefficients?


## Random Coefficients
According to the polynomial of Shamir secret sharing,
the expected value of these cofficients will be $$f(x) / \sum_i x^i$$,
which is about `225568696201524096821742572483714374706`.

However, the real random number generator they choice can't generate such large number.
I also tested that whether the result is dominated by one of the coefficients (i.e. the secret),
and it's not correct.

Also, the order of three `x` are always same as tho order of `y`,
which means all coefficients are positive.

Based on these result, I guess the coefficients are positive integers.
(Another reason is that I have totally no idea how to convert a fraction to a encryption key. LOL)


## Underconstrained System of Linear Equations
Now, we have a linear system $$Xs = y$$ where $$X$$ is the Vandermonde matrix of those three `x`.
the system is Underconstrained because we have only 3 equations.

Compare to the coefficients, those $$y$$ are much longer.
For such problem, we can solve it with some lattice magic.

However, lattice methods only works with integers.
To convert these fractions to integer,
I scale up both $$X$$ and $$y$$ with $$10^{450}$$, and the equations still hold.

Next, I truncate those fractions to integer and concatenate an identity matrix to $$X$$.
One of the solution becomes
$$
X' [a_0, \cdots, a_4, e_0, e_1, e_2] = y'
$$
where $$e_i$$ is the error introduced by truncating.
Those error would be smaller than sum of those coefficients because the truncated fractions are smaller than 1.

Finally, I concatenate $$y'$$ to $$X'$$ as a column vector, and one of the solution becomes
$$
A [a_0, \cdots, a_4, e_0, e_1, e_2, -1] = 0
$$

The lattice of solutions is $$\{s | As = 0\}$$ which can be defined by the right kernel of $$A$$.

Alse, the solution we want is quite "short".
It's absolute value is about $$10^{40}$$ compared to others which is about $$10^{500}$$.

Finding such vector is hard in general,
but we have suboptimal algorithms like LLL.
And it guarantees to find the shortest one if it is short enough.

We can solve it with sagemath easily:

```python
A = Matrix([
#  Vandemonde              Identity matrix                    y
    x.list() + [1 if i == j else 0 for j in range(len(y))] + [yi]
    for i, (x, yi) in enumerate(zip(X, y))
    ])
B = A.right_kernel_matrix()
print(-B.LLL()[0])
```

You can find the full code at [here]([_files/code.py]).

The result looks like
```
a_0: 285450566584795714324161453455178970870,
a_1: 128443615496666315668191505779431802508,
a_2: 120171678482189002974121031567641762737,
a_3: 29169727575576393604385364950262505188,
a_4: 191216618537187805549913252159424580933,
y_s: -1,
e_0: 138021328216454971007230221028671168120,
e_1: 48993614216086579566584094608235291082,
e_2: -85525054552282748747414766196213187078
```

The last thing is to guess the encryption algorithm,
it turns out to be AES CBC with null IV.

# Solution
## TL;DR
1. Calculate the bucket number of <root, pwd>
2. Search 1000 credentials has same bucket number and register them.
3. Login with <root, pwd>


The task has two operation, register and login.
It store the credential using:
```
sha512(sha512(name) + password)
```
As far as I know, no collision attack is available on this kind of digest method.
But the server has some interesting code when it search for hash:
```C++
auth_result lookup_keyvalue(const std::string& name, const std::string& password) {
    std::string digest = sha512sum(name, password);
    size_t bucket = values.bucket(digest);

    auto it = values.begin(bucket), end = values.end(bucket);
    size_t iterations = 0;
    size_t MAX_ITERATIONS = 1000;

    while (it != end) {
        if (*it++ == digest)
            return AUTH_SUCCESS; // 1

        // Avoid DoS attacks by fixing upper time limit.
        if (iterations++ >= MAX_ITERATIONS)
            return AUTH_TIMEOUT; // 2
    }

    return AUTH_FAILURE; // 0
}
...
            if (table.lookup_keyvalue(name, password)) {
                // login successfully, check root and print flag
...
```
We can login when it reach the limit of iterations,
Search for 1000 credentials with same bucket number as `root, pwd`,
register them and login with `root, pwd` to get the flag.
Here's the [code]([_files/dos.cpp]).
